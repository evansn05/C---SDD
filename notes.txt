ive honestly skipped over most the higher content in these files as well not need most of them
the AH and N5 content is where my focus is going to be in these files, since im wishing to do C++ for a project
also if possible id like to redo the object orientated program we had prior in python
for the H content i went up to SDD-04 just so we could at least have referneces on how to work functions in C++
im not going beyond that because:
a) ive mucked about with my files and strayed beyond the task from mr hunters "do something useful" instructions
b) they are so completely pointless for almost anything
i might do SDD-07 for higher at a later date but honestly at this moment i dont need it 

ive created a really loose idea for a robot code below, idk what theyre doing so this is based entirely on the old design
its probably some form of pseudocode?? nothing overadvanced i hope

object -> robot 
methods -> simply to run a constructor and assign variables

object -> conveyor
inherits -> robot 
methods -> move up, move down, stop

object -> intake 
inherits -> robot 
methods -> move in, move out, stop

object -> controller
inherits -> robot
methods -> update drive from joystick, check for buttons being pressed and run method from other object
